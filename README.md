# customrules-try-2

for Dino

Hello Dino,

This plugin took me a really long time to get it in its working state, it has alot of features for general SMP servers.

It blocks ancient debris from spawning, and netherite scrap from spawning. So no netherite, the only way to get netherite is to kill a wither.

Elytra PVP block, players cant use elytras within 10 seconds of being hit or hit someone.

Totems are totally banned, there is no way to get them.

End crystals cant be placed on obsidian, only bedrock so you still can revive the dragon.

There is a command that removes all netherite in the world /clearnetherite.

pls dont distribute this plugin as it is my own code.

Thanks :)
